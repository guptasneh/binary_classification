In this project, we analyzed a food delivery dataset to classify deliveries as either "fast" or "delayed" based on features such as distance and delivery person experience. After preprocessing the data—including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and converting delivery time into binary classes—we applied three machine learning models: Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. The Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of X%, KNN performed with Y% accuracy (best when k=3), and the Decision Tree model provided Z% accuracy with a maximum depth of 3 ROC curves and AUC scores further validated model performance, showing that [food_prediction] had the highest AUC, making it the most reliable for this classification task. Overall, while all models performed reasonably well, [model name] is recommended for its balance of accuracy and interpretability. Further improvements can be made by including time-based and environmental features such as traffic or weather.
